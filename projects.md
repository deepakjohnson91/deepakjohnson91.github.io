This is a list of projects that I have worked in the recent months. Some of them are yet to be completed. Please get in touch with me (over email), in case you are interested.  

### Price and Non-Price Factors in Rice Cultivation: A Comparative Sutdy of Kerala and the Mekong Delta  
This is the extension of my PhD work, where I compare the relative contribution of price and non-price factors in incomes from rice cultivation in Kerala (in southern India) and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. 
The two study regions are associated with similar agroclimatic conditions, land distribution, and historical importance of rice production. The data for this study comes from detailed household surveys conducted in two best-performing villages within these regions. 
A research paper from this study is under preparation now.  

### Trends in Costs and Incomes from Crop Production in India
This was a component of the [research project](https://fas.org.in/research/research-projects/trends-in-gender-division-of-work-and-wages-in-rural-india/) titled “Big Data Analysis to Understand Trends in Gender Division of Work and Wages in Rural India and Trends in Costs and Incomes from Crop Production in India.”
This project was undertaken by the Foundation for Agrarian Studies in association with the Evidence Module of the CGIAR GENDER Platform led by the International Rice Research Institute.
I was involved in the component related to costs and incomes from crop production, where we analysed cost of cultivation data for 10 selected crops for the period 2000-01 to 2019-20.  

### Using the Unit-level Data of the Situation Assessment Survey 2018-19
India's National Sample Survey conducted its 77th Round of surveys in 2018-19. Among different topics covered in this round was the assessment of farming conditions in India. 
This personal project provides documentation and codes for using the unit-level data of this survey. The GitHub repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/deepakjohnson91/NSSO-77-Round-SAS).
