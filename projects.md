This is a list of projects that I have worked in recent months. Some of them are yet to be completed. Please get in touch with me (over email), in case you are interested. Or you are welcome to come and visit me at my workplace.   

### Farm Households and Salaried Work in India  
This is a joint work with Professor Takashi Kurosaki. We examine the role of salaried employment among agricultural households over three points in time in India, using the National Sample Survey's Situation Assessment Surveys. The latest round of the survey was conducted in 2018&#8211;19. 
A GitHub repository on how this dataset can be used is [here](https://github.com/deepakjohnson91/NSSO-77-Round-SAS). Our analysis of data is focused on how household incomes and its components have changed over time. We are particularly interested in checking if there has been any increase in household members accessing salaried employment and its contribution to the overall household income. This is an ongoing work and we have a first draft of the paper with us. 

### Green Revolution in India and Conceptualising the Change 
This is a joint work with Sandipan Baksi and C. A. Sethu. We respond to some recent re-evaluations of the Green Revolution in India, especially those concerning whether the Green Revolution has actually increased foodgrain production or not. We used the publicly available data for working on this project. The research paper was published in the [*Economic and Political Weekly*](https://www.epw.in/journal/2024/52/special-articles/green-revolution-india.html). 

### Trends in Costs and Incomes from Crop Production in India
This was a component of the [research project](https://fas.org.in/research/research-projects/trends-in-gender-division-of-work-and-wages-in-rural-india/) titled “Big Data Analysis to Understand Trends in Gender Division of Work and Wages in Rural India and Trends in Costs and Incomes from Crop Production in India.” The report is available on the above webpage for download. 
This project was undertaken by the Foundation for Agrarian Studies in association with the Evidence Module of the CGIAR GENDER Platform led by the International Rice Research Institute.
I was involved in the component related to costs and incomes from crop production, where we analysed cost of cultivation data for 10 selected crops for the period 2000&#8211;01 to 2019&#8211;20.  

### Price and Non-Price Factors in Rice Cultivation: A Comparative Sutdy of Kerala and the Mekong Delta  
This is the extension of my PhD work, where I compare the relative contribution of price and non-price factors in incomes from rice cultivation in Kerala (in southern India) and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. 
The two study regions are associated with similar agroclimatic conditions, land distribution, and historical importance of rice production. The data for this study comes from detailed household surveys conducted in two best-performing villages within these regions. 
A working paper version, written in collaboration with Professor Takashi Kurosaki, is available [here](https://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/Common/publication/DP/DPS-A741.pdf). The final version was published in *Asia & the Pacific Policy Studies*. Find the link to the journal article [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app5.399).
