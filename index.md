I am a JSPS ([Japan Society for the Promotion of Science](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/)) Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University](https://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/English/), Tokyo, Japan. 
Prior to this, I worked as an Associate Fellow at the [Foundation for Agrarian Studies](https://fas.org.in/), Bengaluru, India.  

I completed my PhD in Development Studies from the [Indian Statistical Institute Bangalore Centre](https://www.isibang.ac.in/) in 2021. 
The degree was awarded by the [Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai](https://tiss.edu/).  

My interest areas are development economics and agricultural economics. 
I am currently exploring the contribution of price and non-price factors in agricultural development, with specific reference to India and Vietnam.  

I am also interested in visualisation of data. Some of my visualisations are present in the [Projects](https://deepakjohnson91.github.io/projects) page.  

A note about my name: My official name is "Karayamparambil Deepak Johnson" with "Karayamparambil" being my surname/family name. However, I prefer to use "Deepak Johnson" for the sake of simplicity.
